# updWallp

## About updWallp
updWallp is a small bash script which picks a random image from a user-defined folder,
generates a dimmed & blured version of it and set that as new wallpaper on your linux desktop

The basic idea is inspired by Muzei


## Requirements
- ImageMagick (must have)

- notify-send (nice to have for notifications)
